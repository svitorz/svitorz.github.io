      <p class="text-stone-700 dark:text-stone-300">
        i am a passionate full-stack developer, always looking for new
        challenges and opportunities to grow. i have strong experience with web
        development, working mainly with laravel, vue.js, and docker. as a linux
        enthusiast, i spend most of my time in the terminal, optimizing
        workflows and contributing to open-source projects. i am also a
        researcher in affective computing, exploring how technology can enhance
        human-computer interaction. outside of coding, i am a huge basketball
        fan, supporting the los angeles clippers, and a football enthusiast,
        cheering for the s√£o paulo fc and following patrick mahomes in the nfl.
